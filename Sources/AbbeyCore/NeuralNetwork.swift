/// Corrected from the reference draft in two ways, both purely mechanical (not a
/// design change, so not flagged as an open decision):
///   1. `forward` is non-mutating. It reads `weights`/`biases` but never writes them,
///      so marking it `mutating` was incorrect and caused spurious `await` call sites
///      when `NeuralNetwork` is a stored property of an actor (DQNAgent) — a plain
///      synchronous struct method call needs no `await` even from within an actor.
///   2. The SIMD8 packing pads/truncates to exactly 8 scalars *before* constructing the
///      SIMD8 value, using a concrete `[Float]` (not a slice) so the element count the
///      `SIMD8(_:)` sequence initializer receives is unambiguous.
